# BT81X-Bunny-Pizza
A simple video game to be played on Riverdi screen connected with ESP32 microcontroller.


### Current Issues ###
```
-Font of 20 is glitching since this morning (not an issue last week. Glitch remains when loading previous versions of the program)
-Bunny bitmap glitches when it reaches left border of screen
-Pizzas glitching in "avoid pizzas" version as the y range initialized is larger than in the "collect pizzas" version. Offscreen pizza appears to wrap around to the middle of the screen. 
```
